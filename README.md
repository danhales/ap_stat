# ap_stat
A repo with helpful python tools for AP Statistics teachers.

This repository is a work in progress, centered around my `ap_stat` module. The goal is to create python tools for AP Statistics teachers to use in their classroom, in order to give a data science flavor to their traditional statistics curriculum.
